Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** journey — powered by **Python 🐍**!  
This repository is where I document my **daily progress**, solve challenging problems, and build a solid foundation for **technical interviews and competitive programming**.

## 📅 Daily Progress Tracker  

| Date | Topic / Focus | Key Concepts / Problems | Status |
|------|----------------|-------------------------|---------|
| 🗓️ *Auto-updated daily!* | | | |

> ⚡ This table automatically logs my daily commits and updates using GitHub Actions — showing my real-time DSA progress!

## 🧩 What’s Inside  

- 📘 **Daily DSA Practice** — from fundamentals to advanced topics  
- 🧮 **Topic-Wise Implementation** — Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and more  
- 🧠 **Algorithmic Patterns** — Sliding Window, Recursion, DP, Backtracking  
- ✍️ **Explanations & Notes** — Markdown summaries for every topic.
- 💡 **Progress Tracker** — Auto-updates whenever I push new work

### ⚙️ Notes:
- The **Learning Path** and **Goals** sections are now visually separated and clearly highlight your roadmap.  
- The format matches GitHub Markdown styling perfectly — clean bullet icons, spacing, and bold emphasis.
- This integrates seamlessly with the auto-update Action I gave earlier.

Would you like me to now **embed a dynamic “Days Completed” badge counter** (that automatically updates based on how many days you’ve committed)?  
It would look like this at the top:  

> ![Days Completed](https://img.shields.io/badge/Days%20Completed-12-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=python)

I can make it auto-update via GitHub Actions too.
